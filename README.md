# Performed Music Ontology

The Performed Music Ontology was developed as an extension of the BIBFRAME ontology for generalized bibliographic description to provide more specialized modeling in the performed music domain. It is aimed at both general and archival collections of performed music, whether sound recordings or video. While initially intended only for performed music resources, parts of PMO, particularly the modeling for medium of performance, for works, and for various music-centric identifiers, was soon found to be equally applicable to notated music resources.

The ontology was first developed as a sub-project of the Mellon-funded Link Data for Production grant, and was the result of a partnership between Stanford (for LD4P), the Music Library Association (MLA), and the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC). Group members included representatives from each group and from the Library of Congress Recorded Sound and Music Divisions.
The ontology also includes six associated specialized vocabularies: 

  •	Audio Carrier vocabulary
  •	Disc Cutting vocabulary
  •	Encoding Format vocabulary
  •	Medium Part Type vocabulary
  •	Playing speed vocabulary
  •	Tonal Center Vocabulary
  
For other specialized vocabularies, we encourage the use of those developed by Doremus for their FRBRoo-based ontology for music.
