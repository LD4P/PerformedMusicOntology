# PerformedMusicOntology
An extension of the BIBFRAME ontology for describing performed music, both for mainstream and archival performed music collections.

## Objectives for the Performed Music Project
- Build on LC's work, evaluate the BIBFRAME ontology for describing performed music, both for mainstream and archival performed music collections
- Evaluate other available linked data ontologies and vocabularies for extending and/or expanding BIBFRAME to better accommodate performed music
- Create and document a linked data ontology for performed music, using BIBFRAME and either BIBFRAME extensions or already existing ontologies.
- Develop an RDA profile to complement the ontology for use by the library community
- Suggest preferred vocabularies for use by the library community
- Catalog a representative selection of performed music resources using the new ontology, and make them publically available
- Determine any augmentations/manipulations of MARC records for performed music that would enhance results when converted to the new ontology
- Evaluate results of project and share set of recommendations for further research and development
- Inform the development of metadata production tools to ensure compatibility for describing performed music
